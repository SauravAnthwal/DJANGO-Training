                The game is perfect, the combat has been perfected with many different mobs to fight within their respective realms as
                well as the innumerable amount of mini-bosses, bosses, and side bosses. The story as well is unparalleled, there are
                virtually no plot holes, and it takes a lot from Norse mythology and other neighboring mythologies/legends. Every
                character has been developed to the point where it makes the game feel so surreal. The fact that the game is so amazing
                just makes me want to think that God of War (2018) was simply the prequel and building block to this amazing game. They
                quite literally made everything so much better compared to the 2018 game. All the issues with God of War were fixed and
                amplified in God of War: Ragnar√∂k. The game immersion as well is so much better than any other story game I've ever
                played, and I had thought God of War's immersion was amazing. In the end, I have no complaints or problems with this
                game because in my books, this is the best game I have ever played.
